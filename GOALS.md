- Added new compound and its properties 'Magnesium'
- Understand UseEffect by reading Documentation
10 %
- Enhance the useEffect for notifications to include more conditions (e.g., warnings for exceeding max daily dose).
(Done)


- Add a "Dismiss" button to notifications in the UI
- Add a "Reset" button to reset doses and start fresh
- Enhance the 3D visualization
- Implement User Authentication
- Add a circadin Rhtyhm Visualization



- Error Handling: Add error handling for edge cases, such as invalid input values in the Input component or missing compound data in the SupplementTracker.
- Accessibility: Ensure all components are accessible (e.g., add aria-* attributes to Button, Input, and Alert components).
- Performance: Optimize the BrainVisualization component to avoid unnecessary re-renders. For example, memoize the particle system calculations or use useMemo for expensive computations.
- Real-Time Updates: Consider using a Web Worker or requestIdleCallback to offload heavy calculations (e.g., generateTimePoints) from the main thread.
- Compound Interactions: Expand the interaction model to include more complex pharmacokinetic interactions (e.g., competitive inhibition, enzyme induction).
- Responsive Design: Ensure the UI is fully responsive, especially for mobile devices. For example, the BrainVisualization component might need adjustments for smaller screens.
- Tooltips and Guidance: Add tooltips or a help section to explain complex concepts (e.g., synergistic score, circadian alignment).
- Unit Tests: Write tests for critical components (e.g., calculateConcentration, Button, Input) using a testing library like Jest or Vitest.
- End-to-End Tests: Use a tool like Cypress to test user flows (e.g., adding a dose, adjusting thresholds).
  
- Expand the Compound Database:

Add more compounds (e.g., adaptogens, vitamins) and their pharmacokinetic data.

Include user-generated compounds for customization.
- User Authentication and Data Storage:

Implement user accounts to save and track supplement regimens over time.

Use a backend service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) to store user data securely.
- Gamification:

Add gamified elements (e.g., streaks, achievements) to encourage consistent use.

For example, reward users for maintaining optimal circadian alignment or synergistic scores
- Community Features:

Allow users to share their supplement stacks and experiences.

Create a forum or social feed within the app.

- Add More Utilities:

Consider adding utility functions for common tasks like date formatting, validation, or data transformation.
