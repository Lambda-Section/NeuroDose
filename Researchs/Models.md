1. Cognitive Enhancement and Supplement Stacking
Research Question: How do different supplement combinations (e.g., caffeine + L-theanine) affect cognitive performance over time?

Approach:

Conduct a literature review on nootropics and their interactions.

Use your application to simulate and analyze the effects of various supplement stacks.

Publish findings on optimal dosing schedules and synergistic combinations.

2. Personalized Supplement Regimens
Research Question: Can personalized supplement regimens improve cognitive performance compared to generic dosing guidelines?

Approach:

Collect user data (e.g., sleep patterns, cognitive tasks) to tailor supplement recommendations.

Implement machine learning algorithms to predict optimal doses based on user profiles.

Validate the model through user studies.

3. Circadian Rhythm and Supplement Timing
Research Question: How does the timing of supplement intake relative to circadian rhythms affect efficacy and side effects?

Approach:

Extend the calculateCircadianAlignment function to incorporate more circadian factors (e.g., melatonin levels, cortisol peaks).

Conduct a study to compare the effects of morning vs. evening dosing for different compounds.

4. 3D Visualization in Health Applications
Research Question: How does 3D visualization improve user understanding and engagement in health applications?

Approach:

Compare user interactions with 2D vs. 3D visualizations in your application.

Publish findings on the effectiveness of 3D visualization for conveying complex health data.

5. Ethical Considerations in Cognitive Enhancement
Research Question: What are the ethical implications of widespread cognitive enhancement through supplements?

Approach:

Explore topics like accessibility, equity, and long-term health impacts.

Write a position paper or opinion piece based on your findings.
